vGoogle created TensorFlow to replace Theano. The two libraries are in fact quite similar. Some of the creators of Theano, such as Ian Goodfellow, went on to create Tensorflow at Google before leaving for OpenAI.For the moment, TensorFlow does not support so-called “inline matrix operations, but forces you to copy a matrix in order to perform an operation on it. Copying very large matrices is costly in every sense. TF takes 4x as long as the state of the art deep learning tools. Google says its working on the problem.Like most deep-learning frameworks, TensorFlow is written with a Python API over a C/C++ engine that makes it run faster. Although there is experimental support for a Java API it is not currently considered stable, we do not consider this a solution for the Java and Scala communities.TensorFlow runs dramatically slower than other frameworks such as CNTK and MxNet.TensorFlow is about more than deep learning. TensorFlow actually has tools to support reinforcement learning and other algos.Google’s acknowledged goal with Tensorflow seems to be recruiting, making their researchers code shareable, standardizing how software engineers approach deep learning, and creating an additional draw to Google Cloud services, on which TensorFlow is optimized.TensorFlow is not commercially supported, and it’s unlikely that Google will go into the business of supporting open-source enterprise software. Its giving a new tool to researchers.Like Theano, TensforFlow generates a computational graph (e.g. a series of matrix operations such as z = sigmoid(x) where x and z are matrices) and performs automatic differentiation. Automatic differentiation is important because you don’t want to have to hand-code a new variation of backpropagation every time youre experimenting with a new arrangement of neural networks. In Googles ecosystem, the computational graph is then used by Google Brain for the heavy lifting, but Google hasnt open-sourced those tools yet. TensorFlow is one half of Googles in-house DL solution.Google introduced Eager, a dynamic computation graph module for TensorFlow, in October 2017.From an enterprise perspective, the question some companies will need to answer is whether they want to depend upon Google for these tools, given how Google developed services on top of Android, and the general lack of enterprise support.Caveat: Not
